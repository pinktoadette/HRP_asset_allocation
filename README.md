# Markowitz Asset Allocation and Alternatives

These notebooks are only to examine the individual theories and its implementation specifically.

The traditional markowitz efficient frontier vs Hierarchical Risk Parity based on Lopez de Prado.

Traditional efficient frontier looks at the standard deviation to returns of a security and optimizes the weights.

### HRP
HRP contains 3 main steps
* Divides up the assets into hierarchical clusters
* Assets separated into clusters by correlation
* Recursive Bisection
