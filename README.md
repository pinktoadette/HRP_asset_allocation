# Alternative to Efficient Frontier

This notebook is to examine alternative to traditional markowitz efficient frontier by looking at Hierarchical Risk Parity based on Lopez de Prado.

### Markowitz Efficient Frontier
Traditional efficient frontier looks at the standard deviation to returns of a security and optimizes the weights.

### HRP
HRP contains 3 main steps
* Divides up the assets into hierarchical clusters
* Assets separated into clusters by correlation
* Recursive Bisection
